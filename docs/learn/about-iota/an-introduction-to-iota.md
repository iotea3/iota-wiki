# What is IOTA ?

IOTA is an open source, feeless and scalable distributed ledger, designed to support frictionless data and value transfer.

The name IOTA denotes various elements of the IOTA Foundation’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions. IOTA is a distributed ledger technology built on a proprietary directed acyclic graph (DAG) called the Tangle, which you can picture as a multi-dimensional blockchain. It allows for the exchange of information and value on a decentralized platform that enables direct and secure transfers, which are executed through and recorded immutably on the network. The base layer, referred to either as “IOTA” or “the Tangle,” allows for feeless micro-payment transactions between devices. This provides the basis for what the IOTA Foundation dubs a “machine economy” and supports multiple other use cases. 

Iota is also the name of the native currency on this protocol, distinguishable from the name of the protocol by its lowercase formatting. One iota is the smallest unit of currency available for purchase. A finite number of approximately 2.7 quadrillion iotas exist. You can think of one iota as being similar to the smallest available unit of Bitcoin (BTC), one satoshi. All of the iotas in circulation were created by the very first transaction on the Tangle, called the “genesis transaction.” IOTA is non-inflationary by design, meaning that its value cannot be diluted by exponentially increasing the amount of tokens in order to, for example, reward miners or stakers for their services. 

IOTA is currently developed and maintained primarily by the IOTA Foundation, which is a global charitable non-profit organization that is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. The IOTA Foundation is a global network of developers, designers, engineers and entrepreneurs working to make IOTA a comprehensive and secure distributed ledger technology. The Foundation aims to transform IOTA into an enabling technology that will be adopted and customized by enterprises and individuals across industries and use cases. 

## Why Use IOTA

As a distributed ledger technology, IOTA provides a trust layer for any devices that are connected to the global Internet.

Through its open network of nodes, IOTA allows humans and machines to:
- Use the network as a source of truth for data
- Transfer value in IOTA tokens

## Who is IOTA for?

IOTA can benefit many people, including the following important groups.

### Anyone who does not trust centralized networks
IOTA networks are peer-to-peer networks where no central authority controls the data. Instead, all nodes hold a copy of it and reach a consensus on its contents.

### Anyone who wants to secure their data
Everything in the Tangle is immutable and transparent. Through cryptography, you can prove that data has not changed.

### Anyone who wants the freedom to transact
IOTA is free to use. You don't need to pay a subscription, sign a contract, or have any form of official identification. Even transactions are feeless.
